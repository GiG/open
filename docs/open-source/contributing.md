# Contributing to Third-Party Open Source Software

GiG employees are encouraged to contribute to Open Source Software for various reasons, mainly:

* Improve the software we rely on
* Improve their skills
* E-Meet people from the community

Contributions to Third-Party Open Source Software is not necessarily source-code contribution. Employees are also encouraged to contribute:

* Documentation
* Examples
* Restructuring project layout (to improve usability)
* Tutorials
* Issue grooming
* Answer questions (GitHub, Reddit, StackOverflow)
* Moderate discussions

## Before you contribute

Remember, before you open an issue or pull request, check the project's contributing docs (usually a file called `CONTRIBUTING.md`, or in the `README.md`), to see whether you need to include anything specific. For example, they may ask that you follow a template, or require that you use tests.

Sometimes, you may find projects that require you to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). If you have doubts about the CLA for that particular project, you should contact the GiG Open Source Initiative Team so they can review and guide you on how to proceed.

## Behavior

Remember, that when contributing as a GiG Employee your actions reflect on GiG as well, so it's important to adopt GiG's values in your behavior, namely:

* Be considerate, kind, constructive, and helpful
* Do not engage in demeaning, discriminatory, harassing, hateful, sexualized, or physically threatening behavior, speech, and imagery
* Do not engage in unwanted physical contact
* Resolve peacefully
* Abide by the project's Contributor Covenant
