# Contributing to Third-Party Open Source Software

GiG employees are encouraged to contribute to Open Source Software for various reasons, mainly:

* Improve the software we rely on
* Improve their skills
* E-Meet people from the community

Contributions to Third-Party Open Source Software is not necessarily source-code contribution. Employees are also encouraged to contribute:

* Documentation
* Examples
* Restructuring project layout (to improve usability)
* Tutorials
* Issue grooming
* Answer questions (GitHub, Reddit, StackOverflow)
* Moderate discussions

Remember, before you open an issue or pull request, check the project's contributing docs (usually a file called `CONTRIBUTING.md`, or in the `README.md`), to see whether you need to include anything specific. For example, they may ask that you follow a template, or require that you use tests.
