# Forking a Third-Party Repository

!!! note
    This page is not talking about the action of forking a project for the sake of submitting a pull request to the main repository, but rather forking for taking ownership of the project. 
    
    This is allowed, but any forks for this purpose should never be forked under the `gig/` namespace

Forking a Third-Party repository **for taking ownership of the project** should be done as a last resort. Consider the following:

* Why not contribute to the main project instead?
* Do you have the required resources to maintain the **whole** project and not just your changes?
* Do you have a strategy to keep your fork updated with changes upstream?
* Make sure the `LICENSE` of the project allows forking and is a `LICENSE` that is accepted by GiG.
* If a repository is forked as a GiG Project, it has to follow [the same standards and guidelines as if GiG is the original creator of the project](creating.md).
  * This means the project has to go through the same approval process
