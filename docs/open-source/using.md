# Using Open Source Software

At GiG it is encouraged to adopt open-source mentality, both internally and externally (when possible). Using open source software enables us to compete at the level of larger tech companies and enable the flexibility, interoperability and cost savings that these solutions provide. 

When considering adopting technologies, positive weight should be given to technologies that are open-source and are actively maintained by a community.

If you use open source technologies, we strongly encourage you to contribute back to the project and be an active member of the community.

Remember to be careful and comply with the licenses. Besides, itâ€™s the right thing to do out of respect for our fellow coders.

GiG is adopting the Google stance on AGPL. **This means that software licensed under the AGPL is NOT allowed at GiG**. For more details visit [go/agpl](https://opensource.google/docs/using/agpl-policy/).
