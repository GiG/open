# Creating Open Source Software (or open-sourcing internal software)

There are serious legal implications anytime a GIGster open-sources code. The GiG Open Source Initiative has a process that you must follow to help us comply with our legal and ethical obligations.

We actively encourage employees to open-source internal software as much as possible as long as the projects meet GiG's Open Source requirements.

!!! question "When not to Open Source a Project?"
    In general, the number one reason not to open source a project is that it includes, or links to, GiG's “secret sauce” or sensitive data because doing so can create security issues or erode our competitive advantage. If in doubt, contact the open-source team on open-source@gig.com
